This project will be contributed by 4 teammates and it is expected to be delivery before 3/01/2020

Fractal geometry paves a path to understand complexity in systems. The fractal geometry can be employed to describe the unpredictable timing and shape. For examples: it could explain the time and size of earthquakes, the variation in a person's blood vessel systems and the widespread diseases. 
The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that relies on repeated calculations with complex numbers. It vitalizes significant mathematical research and is widely used to generate an interesting visual image in fractals. To explore the Mandelbrot set, we need to work in the complex plane, and then repeatedly square each point zk+1 = z 2 k ,k = 0, 1, . . . For which initial values z0 does the sequence {zk}k≥0 remain bounded as k → ∞? As a result, the set is basically the unit disc, |z0| ≤ 1. If |z0| > 1, then the sequence is limitless. Although it looks very simple, the compelling aggregate could be provoked. Thus, the Mandelbrot set lifts the veil on the hidden beauty of the world.  Due to the charm and beauty of the Mandelbrot set, we agree to tackle both mathematical and programming parts so that we can explore and prove the concept of this famous fractal.
